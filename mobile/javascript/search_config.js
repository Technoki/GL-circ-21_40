As a result, the installation of officers of certain subordinate lodges in                this jurisdiction previously scheduled between March 15 – 30, 2020 have been                cancelled, leaving these lodges without proper turn-over of officers.                         The  incoming  officers  of  these  lodges  have  been  duly  elected  and                proclaimed  in  December  2019  and  have  already  manifested  acceptance  of                their respective positions since that date.  However, they are unable to occupy                their positions due to failure to hold installation ceremonies in a tyled or public                form and executed in the formalities required by our ordinances.

Upon  submission  of  the  said  manifestation  complete  with  names  and                titles of both the incumbent and the officers-elect replacing them, the Grand                Lodge shall forthwith issue the proper appointment papers to the Acting Lodge                Officers, provided that those continuing in office (such as wardens, secretaries,","2 | P a g e                Circular No. 40 – MW Suan                 treasurers,  and  auditors  who  were  re-elected  to  their  same  positions  in  the                immediately preceding elections in December 2019) shall continue in their full                capacity by virtue of their previous installation in 2019.
